This projects goal is to understand the logic of the diamonds values. It is divided in 2 main parts : descriptive analysis and recommendation dashboard.

*Descriptive analysis*:

It does show the main stats that helps us to understand the composition of the dataset. Moreover, it supports some of the following insights with visualisations.

- The sample has a total of 40455 diamonds
- carat: the average weight is 0.79, with a minimum weight is 0.2 and the max is 4.5
- depth: the average is 61.75mm , min = 43 and max = 79
- Correlation: carat , price , lenght , width and dept have a positive correlation . Price volatility will be more sensitive to those variables.
- Most of the diamonds price are between 326€ (min) &  2400€ (50% quantile)
- The price grows exponentially from 0.2 carat until 2.5 carat. From 2.5 there are not that many diamonds and there is not that many correlation between carat and price
- The price of the diamonds grows exponentially from 4 mm long. In addition , after 9 mm long the price does not change that much.
- Most of the diamonds have a width between 3-9 mm
- The price grows exponentially between 2-5mm depth


*Recommendations*
